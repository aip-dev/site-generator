Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 â€“ 9 June 1870) was an English
writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional
characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian
era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the
20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His
novels and short stories are still widely read today.

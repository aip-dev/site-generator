# Orpheus

William Shakespeare

    Orpheus with his lute made trees
    And the mountain tops that freeze
      Bow themselves when he did sing:
    To his music plants and flowers
    Ever sprung; as sun and showers
      There had made a lasting spring.

    Every thing that heard him play,
    Even the billows of the sea,
      Hung their heads and then lay by.
    In sweet music is such art,
      Killing care and grief of heart
      Fall asleep, or hearing, die.

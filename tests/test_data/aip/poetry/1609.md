# Sonnet 1

Sonnets have 14 lines:

1. From fairest creatures we desire increase,
2. That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,
3. But as the riper should by time decrease,
4. His tender heir might bear his memory:
5. But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
6. Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel.
7. Making a famine where abundance lies,
8. Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
9. Thou that are now the world’s fresh ornament
10. And only herald to the gaudy spring,
11. Within thine own bud buriest thy content
12. And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
13. Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
14. To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.

If a sonnet doth not have 14 lines, tis not a sonnet.

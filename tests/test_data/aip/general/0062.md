Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what
we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for the sake of
exactness in all points, to mention here the various rumors and remarks which
had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the
diocese. True or false, that which is said of men often occupies as important a
place in their lives, and above all in their destinies, as that which they do.
M. Myriel was the son of a councillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he
belonged to the nobility of the bar. It was said that his father, destining him
to be the heir of his own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen
or twenty, in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in
parliamentary families. In spite of this marriage, however, it was said that
Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk. He was well formed, though rather
short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent; the whole of the first
portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry.

# The Hunchback of Notre Dame

A few years ago, while visiting or, rather, rummaging about Notre-Dame, the
author of this book found, in an obscure nook of one of the towers, the
following word, engraved by hand upon the wall:

## Guidance

```
ἈΝÁΓΚΗ.
```

These Greek capitals, black with age, and quite deeply graven in the stone,
with I know not what signs peculiar to Gothic caligraphy imprinted upon their
forms and upon their attitudes, as though with the purpose of revealing that it
had been a hand of the Middle Ages which had inscribed them there, and
especially the fatal and melancholy meaning contained in them, struck the
author deeply.

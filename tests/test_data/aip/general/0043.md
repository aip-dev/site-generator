# A Christmas Carol

Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The
register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,
and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge’s name was good upon
’Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a
door-nail.

## Guidance

Mind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is
particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to
regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the
wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not
disturb it, or the Country’s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat,
emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.
